# Hammerhead Torch
A simple torch app, originally written for the LG Nexus 5 (codename "hammerhead") port of Sailfish OS.

This branch used qtmultimedia to control the torch by default, and falls back to the controlfile method if that doesn't work.

The qtmultimedia method is currently not supported in Sailfish.

Hammerhead Torch now automatically detects the following hardware:
* Jolla A
* LG Nexus 5 ("Hammerhead")
* Fairphone 2
* Motorola Photon Q

Support can be added for any device with an LED that can be controlled using a simple switch file (i.e. file contents 1 for on, 0 for off) by mapping the hardware device name found in /etc/hw-release to the control file path using controlfile.conf.

Feel free to submit a pull request or contact me to add auto-detection support for your device.
